Simple Push Server in Go v1.5.0
===

![PushGo Logo](https://cdn.rawgit.com/mozilla-services/pushgo/dev/logo.jpg)

This server was created to support the [Mozilla Simple Push
protocol](https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/SimplePush). The Go language
was chosen for this implementation as striking the right balance for
operational support, ability to maintain lots of open websockets on
AWS instances, and reasonably light weight. Some other languages and
approaches showed better overall performance, many showed worse. Your
milage may vary.

Please note: PushGo is not a reference implementation of the SimplePush
protocol. It was created in order to support large numbers (1,000,000+
simultaneously connected users) in a cost effective manner. As such, some
features of the protocol are not present, (e.g. message retry, client state
recording, closed channel responses for third party servers, etc.)

## System requirements.

If you require offline storage (e.g. for mobile device usage), we
currently recommend memcache storage.

You will need to have Go 1.3 or higher installed on your system, and the
GOROOT and PATH should be set appropriately for 'go' to be found.

## Compiling
To compile this server:

1. extract this directory into target directory
2. Run: make
3. Run: make simplepush
4. Copy config.sample.toml to config.toml, and edit appropriately

Step 3 should be re-run whenever code has been changed and the server
should be recompiled.

If you would like to use an existing go on your system:
1. Create a bin directory in the target directory
2. Symlink your go binary into the bin directory you made
3. Run the make commands starting at step 2 from above

This will build "simplepush" as an executable.

## Execution
 The server is built to run behind a SSL capable load balancer (e.g.
AWS). For our build, we've found that AWS small instances can manage
to support about 24K simultaneous websocket connections, Mediums can
do about 120K, and Larges can do around 200K.

## Customization
This server currently has no facility for UDP pings. This is a
proprietary function (which, unsurprisingly, works remarkably poorly
with non-local networks). There is currently no "dashboard" for
element management.

This server currently uses one of two methods to connect to memcache.
memcache_gomc uses the store_emcee.go file, and ties to libmemcache.
This library provides a great deal of control over how the server
communicates and uses memcache, however it does require compiling
a local version of libmemcache, which can add difficulty. The
alternate method "memcache_memcachego", uses store_gomemc.go, and uses
a golang based memcache client. While fully functional, we've not
tested this under full load.

If you wish, you can prevent either of these libraries from being
compiled into your executable by changing the extension for either of
these files from ".go" to ".go.skip". This may help you get a demo
server running quickly.

## Use
That's neat and all, but what does this do?

Well, it's easy for a device like a phone to call into a server.
After all, most servers don't fall off the network or get their IP
address radically changed. This service tries to solve for that by
providing a websocket on one side that that reacts when a remote
server pokes it.

Honestly, go read the specification. It does a better job of
explaining things.

## Testing

`make test` runs the accompanying smoke tests. You can also use the
[stand alone test suite](https://github.com/mozilla-services/simplepush_test)
to test this or any other SimplePush server.

## Docker

Pushgo is available in a docker container for easy deployment.

Install the container:

* docker pull bbangert/pushgo:dev

It's recommended that you create a config.toml as described above, and
then volume mount it into the container. If you had your config as
``config/pushgo.toml`` then you could run:

* docker run --rm -v `pwd`/config:/opt/config bbangert/pushgo:dev -config="/opt/config/pushgo.toml"
